            <h3> Hello! </h3>
            <p>
                My name is Riley Knowles and I am a third year computer science undergraduate at the University of British Columbia. Once a dedicated musical theatre performer, I know what it takes to work under pressure and as part of a team. Though that life is behind me, I still sometimes sing while I wash the dishes or hum during my morning yoga flows. <br> <br>
                I am extremely excited to embark on this next chapter of my life as a developer. It is my hope to continue to explore how technology can be used to help others – whether that be to utilize event-driven programming to streamline inconvenient processes, perform data analysis for important biological research, or develop websites for local businesses to be more accessible. With endless possibilities and power, software development is a game changer for my creative, optimistic, and intellectual aspirations.
